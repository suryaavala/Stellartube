The app.js would generate a 12 words passphrase and create PublicKey, PrivateKey and Keystore and store it in the database table "table_walletinfo"

To verify: Copy the PrivateKey or the Seed Phrase and try unlocking it on myetherwallet.com/ Mist/ or any other platform, it should provide you the matching PublicKey exactly same as the one generated from app.js
