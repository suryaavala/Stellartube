Week 2:
Formed group. I created the bitbucket project for the team. We chose to base
our project on blockchain and started assigning roles for the proposal and the
project as a whole. I was given the role of scrum master for the project.

Started working on epic for the interface of the project and researching
blockchain and distributed apps.


Week 3:
Completed epics for mobile and desktop interfaces, coverpage and project
scope sections for the project proposal. My section was given to Natesh to
combine with the rest of the document.

Continued researching blockchain and existing projects to get an idea of
how we can implement our app.


Week 4:
During the lab, ideas for the first sprint were discussed. I took on the role
of handling the interface, and for the first sprint, at least a login page is
to be made.

Split up the interface epics I wrote for the proposal into user stories. Made
wireframes for the homepage, login page, and create an acount page. Also ran
the groups first daily stand up via google hangouts.
