Week 2:
Formed group. I created the bitbucket project for the team. We chose to base
our project on blockchain and started assigning roles for the proposal and the
project as a whole. I was given the role of scrum master for the project.

Started working on epic for the interface of the project and researching
blockchain and distributed apps
